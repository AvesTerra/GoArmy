"Though she be but little, she is fierce." Amalie, we've been jokingly calling her Chira (short for Chiroptera) for her bat ears, is a feisty one year old girl who's looking for a forever home. She loves to play, and is surprisingly dog-like in her tendencies towards belly rubs and chasing her own tail, but she'll also lie next to you and purr for ages
